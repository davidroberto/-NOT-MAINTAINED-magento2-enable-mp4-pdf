# magento2-enable-mp4-pdf

Enable the upload of MP4 videos and PDF files

## Getting Started

By default, Magento 2 doesn't allow the upload of mp4 and pdf files. 
Install the module via composer (the module is available in Packagist) or clone it, and you'll be able to upload PDF files and mp4 videos via the media uploader in cms pages for example.
